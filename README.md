# Event Modeling Application

This is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript, designed to demonstrate event modeling concepts using the `@xyflow/react` library for interactive node-based diagrams. It showcases a robust time-traveling feature, allowing users to navigate through the history of changes made to their event models.

## Key Features

### Core Features

*   **Interactive Event Modeling:** Create and manipulate event models using the four core building blocks (Trigger, Command, Event, View) following the EventModeling.org methodology.
*   **Time-Traveling with Event Sourcing Principles:**
    *   All changes to the diagram are recorded as a sequence of immutable events.
    *   The application's state can be reconstructed by replaying these events from the beginning up to any point in time, enabling powerful undo/redo and historical inspection.

### Pattern Support

*   **Command Pattern:** Create and validate Trigger → Command → Event patterns.
*   **View Pattern:** Connect events to views for displaying event data.
*   **Automation Pattern:** Implement Event → Command → Event chains for automated processes.
*   **Enhanced Validations:** Real-time validation of pattern completeness and correctness.

### Data Management

*   **Enhanced Export/Import:**
    *   **Export Full Model:** Save the entire model state including nodes, edges, events, and metadata.
    *   **Import Model:** Load a previously exported model with support for both legacy and new formats.
    *   **Advanced Import:** Direct JSON state import for advanced users and tooling integration.
*   **Model Statistics:** Track and display comprehensive model statistics and pattern completion rates.
### User Experience

*   **Enhanced History Panel:**
    *   Tabbed interface for history navigation, pattern analysis, and detailed inspection.
    *   Visual indicators for pattern types and completeness.
    *   Detailed property inspection for nodes and edges.
*   **Validation Panel:**
    *   Real-time validation feedback for model correctness.
    *   Highlighting of disconnected nodes and incomplete patterns.
    *   Interactive error and warning messages with element selection.
    *   Model statistics and pattern completion visualization.
*   **Compress Snapshot:**
    *   Optimize storage and performance by creating a "snapshot" of the current diagram state.
    *   When a snapshot is taken, all events leading up to that point are effectively "compressed" and removed from the active event log.
    *   The snapshot becomes the new earliest point to which the history can be rewound, saving memory and speeding up history replay for older states.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript with robust type safety.
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
*   **@xyflow/react:** A powerful library for building interactive node-based editors and diagrams.
*   **nanoid:** A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator.
*   **Vitest:** A blazing fast unit-test framework powered by Vite.

## Event Modeling Concepts

### Building Blocks

1. **Trigger** - External inputs that initiate processes (user actions, time-based events, external system events)
2. **Command** - Instructions to perform actions or make changes to the system
3. **Event** - Facts about what has happened in the system, the source of truth
4. **View** - Representations of data derived from events

### Patterns

1. **Command Pattern** (Trigger → Command → Event)
   - How user actions or external triggers result in system changes
   - Example: User clicks submit (Trigger) → Submit Form (Command) → Form Submitted (Event)

2. **View Pattern** (Event → View)
   - How system state is presented to users
   - Example: Order Placed (Event) → Order List (View)

3. **Automation Pattern** (Event → Command → Event)
   - How events can trigger automatic processes
   - Example: Order Placed (Event) → Ship Order (Command) → Order Shipped (Event)

## React Flow Change Interception Patterns

The application implements specific constraints and behaviors using React Flow's change handling system. This pattern enables fine-grained control over how nodes and edges behave in the diagram.

### Understanding Change Types

React Flow exposes different types of changes through callbacks like `onNodesChange` and `onEdgesChange`. These changes can be intercepted, filtered, modified, or blocked before being applied to the state:

#### Node Change Types

- **`position`**: When nodes are moved (contains `position`, `positionAbsolute`, and `dragging` properties)
- **`dimensions`**: When nodes are resized (contains `dimensions`, `resizing`, and `setAttributes` properties)
- **`select`**: When nodes are selected/deselected (contains `selected` property)
- **`remove`**: When nodes are deleted
- **`add`**: When new nodes are added (contains the entire node object as `item`)
- **`replace`**: When nodes are replaced with new versions (contains `id` and `item`)

#### Edge Change Types

- **`select`**: When edges are selected/deselected (contains `selected` property)
- **`remove`**: When edges are deleted
- **`add`**: When new edges are added (contains the entire edge object as `item`)
- **`replace`**: When edges are replaced with new versions (contains `id` and `item`)

### Implementing Change Interception

The application uses several patterns to intercept and control node and edge changes:

1. **Node & Edge Changes Restrictions:**
   * Swimlanes are prevented from being moved by filtering out position changes for nodes of type `swimlane`
   * Block nodes are constrained to move only horizontally by preserving their original y-position

Here's how different change types can be handled:
```typescript
const onNodesChange = useCallback(
  (changes: NodeChange[]) => {
    // Process each change based on its type
    const processedChanges = changes.map(change => {
      // Handle different change types
      switch (change.type) {
        case 'position':
          // Prevent swimlane movement
          const node = nodes.find(n => n.id === change.id);
          if (node?.type === 'swimlane') {
            // Return null to filter this change out later
            return null;
          }
          
          // Constrain block nodes to horizontal movement only
          if (node?.type === 'block' && change.position) {
            return {
              ...change,
              position: { x: change.position.x, y: node.position.y }
            };
          }
          break;
          
        case 'select':
          // Example: Prevent selection of certain node types
          const selectNode = nodes.find(n => n.id === change.id);
          if (selectNode?.type === 'special-node' && change.selected) {
            return null; // Prevent selection of special nodes
          }
          break;
          
        case 'remove':
          // Example: Prevent deletion of locked nodes
          const removeNode = nodes.find(n => n.id === change.id);
          if (removeNode?.data?.locked) {
            return null; // Prevent removal of locked nodes
          }
          break;
          
        case 'add':
          // Example: Modify properties of newly added nodes
          if (change.item.type === 'block') {
            return {
              ...change,
              item: {
                ...change.item,
                data: { ...change.item.data, initialized: true }
              }
            };
          }
          break;
      }
      return change;
    }).filter(Boolean); // Remove null entries (changes we want to block)
    
    // Apply the filtered and transformed changes
    if (processedChanges.length > 0) {
      dispatchNodeChanges(processedChanges);
    }
  },
  [dispatchNodeChanges, nodes],
);
```

Similarly for edges, we can implement a comprehensive `onEdgesChange` handler:

```typescript
const onEdgesChange = useCallback(
  (changes: EdgeChange[]) => {
    const processedChanges = changes.map(change => {
      switch (change.type) {
        case 'select':
          // Example: Log edge selections for analytics
          console.log('Edge selected:', change.id, change.selected);
          break;
          
        case 'remove':
          // Example: Prevent deletion of critical connections
          const edge = edges.find(e => e.id === change.id);
          if (edge?.data?.critical) {
            return null; // Block deletion of critical edges
          }
          break;
          
        case 'add':
          // Example: Modify properties of newly added edges
          return {
            ...change,
            item: {
              ...change.item,
              animated: true, // Make all new edges animated
              style: { stroke: '#ff0000' } // Style new edges
            }
          };
      }
      return change;
    }).filter(Boolean); // Remove null entries
    
    if (processedChanges.length > 0) {
      dispatchEdgeChanges(processedChanges);
    }
  },
  [dispatchEdgeChanges, edges],
);
```

### Best Practices for Change Interception

1. **Handle All Change Types:** Be aware of all possible change types and handle them appropriately
2. **Filter Changes:** Remove unwanted changes by returning `null` or filtering the array
3. **Transform Changes:** Modify changes by creating new objects with altered properties
4. **Preserve Immutability:** Always create new objects when modifying changes
5. **Optimize Performance:** Only process necessary changes and avoid expensive operations
6. **Apply Changes:** Use the appropriate dispatch function after processing

This pattern provides complete control over React Flow's behavior while maintaining a clean architecture that separates concerns.

## Extending the Application

### How to Add a New Building Block Type

The application supports adding new building block types beyond the core six (Trigger, Command, Event, View, UI, Processor). Here's how to add a new building block type:

1. **Create the Node Component:**
   - Create a new file in `src/components/nodes/` (e.g., `NewBlockNode.tsx`)
   - Implement a React component that follows the styling patterns of existing nodes
   - Use the following template structure:

   ```typescript
   import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';
   import { Handle, Position } from '@xyflow/react';

   export interface NewBlockNodeProps {
     id: string;
     data: {
       label: string;
       // Add any block-specific properties here
     };
     selected: boolean;
     onLabelChange: (nodeId: string, label: string) => void;
   }

   const NewBlockNode: React.FC<NewBlockNodeProps> = ({ id, data, selected, onLabelChange }) => {
     // Implement label editing using useNodeLabelEdit hook or similar pattern
     
     return (
       <div style={{
         // Follow styling consistency with other nodes
         width: '100%',
         height: '100%',
         border: `1px solid ${selected ? '#1a192b' : '#ddd'}`,
         borderRadius: '5px',
         backgroundColor: '#yourColor', // Choose a distinct color
         padding: '10px',
         display: 'flex',
         flexDirection: 'column',
         boxShadow: selected ? '0 0 0 2px #1a192b' : 'none',
       }}>
         {/* Header section with icon and label */}
         <div style={{ /* Header styling */ }}>
           <div style={{ marginRight: '10px', fontSize: '16px' }}>🔍</div>
           {/* Label editing implementation */}
         </div>
         
         {/* Description section */}
         <div style={{ /* Description styling */ }}>
           Block Description
         </div>
         
         {/* Handles - position based on connection rules */}
         <Handle type="target" position={Position.Left} id="in" />
         <Handle type="source" position={Position.Right} id="out" />
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default NewBlockNode;
   ```

2. **Register the Node Type:**
   - Add the new node type to `src/flow/customNodeTypes.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import NewBlockNode from '../components/nodes/NewBlockNode';
   
   export const nodeTypes = {
     // Existing node types
     'NewBlock': NewBlockNode,  // Use PascalCase for the key
   };
   ```
   
   - Ensure the case of the node type matches exactly between the registration and usage

3. **Update Block Type Mapping:**
   - In `src/components/SwimlaneNode.tsx`, add a mapping for the new block type:
   ```typescript
   // Map lowercase block type to React Flow node type
   const getNodeType = (blockType: string) => {
     switch (blockType.toLowerCase()) {
       // Existing mappings
       case 'newblock': return 'NewBlock';  // Map lowercase to PascalCase
       default: return blockType;
     }
   };
   ```
   
   - Important: Make sure to handle case conversion consistently. For example:
   ```typescript
   if (nodeType === 'newblock') nodeType = 'NewBlock';
   ```

4. **Add Event Handling:**
   - In `src/state/eventSourcing.ts`, add a new action type:
   ```typescript
   export const EventTypes = {
     // Existing types
     ModelingEditor: {
       // Existing types
       ADD_NEWBLOCK: 'ADD_NEWBLOCK',
     }
   }
   
   export type ModelingEditorEventType =
     // Existing types
     | { type: typeof EventTypes.ModelingEditor.ADD_NEWBLOCK; payload: any }
   ```
   
   - In `App.tsx`, add dispatch and handler functions:
   ```typescript
   const dispatchAddNewBlock = useCallback((node: any) => {
     dispatch({
       type: EventTypes.ModelingEditor.ADD_NEWBLOCK,
       payload: node
     });
   }, [dispatch]);
   
   const addNewBlock = useCallback(() => {
     // Implementation similar to other block creation functions
     // with appropriate swimlane validation
   }, [dispatchAddNewBlock, selectedSwimlaneId, nodes]);
   ```

5. **Define Connection Rules:**
   - Update connection validation in your pattern validation utilities to define:
     - Which block types can connect to your new block
     - Which block types your new block can connect to
   - Example rule: "NewBlock can only accept connections from Event blocks and can only connect to View blocks"
   - Add appropriate handles to your node component based on these rules

6. **Swimlane Restrictions:**
   - Define which swimlane(s) can contain your new block type
   - Update swimlane logic to enforce these restrictions
   - Example: UI and Processor blocks are restricted to trigger swimlanes only

7. **Add to UI:**
   - Update the Topbar component to include a button for your new block type:
   ```typescript
   // In Topbar.tsx
   interface TopbarProps {
     // Existing props
     onAddNewBlock?: () => void;
   }
   
   // In the render function
   {onAddNewBlock && (
     <button onClick={onAddNewBlock} style={{ /* styling */ }}>
       NewBlock
     </button>
   )}
   ```
   
   - Pass the handler from App.tsx:
   ```typescript
   <Topbar
     // Existing props
     onAddNewBlock={addNewBlock}
   />
   ```

8. **Add Styling:**
   - Define colors for your new block type in `src/types/blockTypes.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const BLOCK_KIND_COLORS: Record<string, string> = {
     // Existing colors
     'NewBlock': 'rgba(your-color-here)',
   };
   
   export const BLOCK_KIND_BORDERS: Record<string, string> = {
     // Existing borders
     'NewBlock': '#your-border-color',
   };
   ```

9. **Styling Consistency Guidelines:**
   - **Text Size:** Use 0.9em for labels, 0.8em for descriptions
   - **Icon Size:** 16px for block icons
   - **Colors:** Choose a distinct color that doesn't clash with existing blocks
   - **Dimensions:** Match other blocks' width and height
   - **Handles:** Position handles consistently (typically left for incoming, right for outgoing)
   - **Borders:** 1px borders with slightly darker shade of the background color
   - **Shadows:** Subtle shadows with 0 0 4px rgba(color, 0.15)

### How to Add a New Swimlane Type

1. **Define the Swimlane Kind:**
   - Add a new swimlane kind to your swimlane type definitions
   - Example: `export type SwimlaneKind = 'event' | 'command_view' | 'trigger' | 'new_lane';`

2. **Update Swimlane Creation Logic:**
   - Modify the swimlane creation function to support the new kind
   - Define the swimlane's position in the vertical stack
   - Set appropriate styling and labels

3. **Define Block Type Restrictions:**
   - Specify which block types are allowed in the new swimlane
   - Update validation logic to enforce these restrictions

4. **Update UI Components:**
   - Add UI elements to create or interact with the new swimlane type
   - Ensure consistent styling with existing swimlanes

5. **Connection Validation:**
   - Update connection validation rules to account for the new swimlane
   - Define how blocks in this swimlane can connect to blocks in other swimlanes

### Connection Rules and Restrictions

When defining connection rules for new block types, consider:

1. **Source and Target Compatibility:**
   - Which block types can be sources for your new block
   - Which block types your new block can target

2. **Swimlane Crossing Rules:**
   - Whether connections can cross between specific swimlanes
   - Direction of allowed crossings (e.g., only top-to-bottom)

3. **Pattern Validation:**
   - How your new block fits into existing patterns (Command, View, Automation)
   - Whether it creates new patterns that need validation

4. **Handle Positioning:**
   - Position handles based on expected connection directions
   - Left handles for incoming connections, right handles for outgoing is the convention

### Example: UI and Processor Blocks

The application includes two specialized block types beyond the core four:

1. **UI Block:**
   - **Styling:** Purple background with computer icon (🖥️)
   - **Connections:** Accepts connections only from View blocks
   - **Swimlane:** Only allowed in 'trigger' swimlane
   - **Handles:** Incoming handle on left, outgoing handle on right

2. **Processor Block:**
   - **Styling:** Gray background with gear icon (⚙️)
   - **Connections:** Accepts connections from Event or View blocks
   - **Swimlane:** Only allowed in 'trigger' swimlane
   - **Handles:** Incoming handle on left, outgoing handle on right

These examples demonstrate how specialized blocks can be added to extend the application's modeling capabilities while maintaining consistent styling and behavior.
